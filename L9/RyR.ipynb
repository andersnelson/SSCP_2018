    "# L10 : Ryanodine Receptor\n",
    "\n",
    "Calcium influx occurs via two principal pathways : inflow from the extracellular medium through calcium channels in the plasma membrane and release from internal stores. Since the inflow from the extracellular medium has been discussed in the previous lectures, here we focus on intra-cellular calcium release pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calcium release from internal storages, in cardiac cells primarily the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is the second major way for calcium to enter the cytoplasm, and is mediated principally by the ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium channels. In this section we will focus on the RyR that got its name due to sensitivity to the plant alkoloid ryanodine which decreases the open probability of the channel by locking the RyRs at its half-open state at nanomolar concentrations, yet fully closes them at micromolar concentration. On the other hand, caffein increases the open probablility of RyRs.\n",
    "\n",
    "RyRs play an important role in the excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) in the heart and underlies the priciple of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), where a small amount of calcium entering the cell initiates an explosive release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Calcium concentrations in the cell both activate and inactivate calcium release from the SR, but at different rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the cytosolic calcium concentration is controled by calcium buffering. Calcium is an important messenger ion involved in different cellular processes and therefore it has a complex transporting and buffering system. Calcium is heavily bound by large proteins in the cell with estimates of around $99\\%$ of the total cytoplasmic calcium. We will discuss this later. \n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, RyRs are sensitive to calcium and hence, a small increase of intracellular calcium concentation can activate RyRs situated in the membrane of the SR and increase the calcium flux into the cytosol through calcium triggered calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). It is also known that calcium can inactivate RyR *in vitro*, but until now it is still unknown whether such an inactivation plays an important physiological role *in vivo*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple model of CICR (Friel, 1995) provides an excellent quantitative description of oscillatory behaviour in response to caffeine, or mild depolarization. Although these oscillations are dependent on external calcium, they occur at a fixed membrane potential and involve the release of calcium from the SR via ryanodine receptors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the simplicity of the model, it is an easy example of how theory can supplement experiments, providing an interpretation of experimental results as well as quantitative predictions that can subsequently be tested.\n",

This ratio is important as it gives an indication of how the flux between two compartments is modulated by its volumes. In other words, the volume together with the ion concentration describes the density of the ions within a compartment and therefore influences the flux between compartments with very different ion densities. \n",

    "\n",
    "Calcium-induced calcium release as described above is an event triggered via opening of RyRs. The major stimulus for CICR is calcium entering the cell via sarcolemmal L-type channels. The rate and amount of calcium release from the SR is tightly controlled by the magnitude and duration of L-type calcium current. CICR is a very local control system, during which calcium enters the cell via the L-type channel increasing the calcium concentration in the dyadic space where the RyR are located in the SR membrane. Thus, this local control of macroscopic SR calcium release is archieved by graded statistical recruitment of individual, autonomous, stochastic release events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the species, from a few tens to approximately 200 RyRs are clustered in a two dimensional crystal-lattice array on the surface of SR release terminals, across the 15nm cleft of te dyad junction between the cell membrane and the SR. In  mathematical models, the activation of the RyRs is simulated by stochastic interactions via calcium entering in the dyadic cleft through the L-Type channel. To represent the stochastic nature of RyRs, usually a Markov model approach is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the set of channels at each dyad is treated as a single stochastic system whose state is defined by specifying the Markov state of each of the individual channels. State transitions of individual channels are considered to take place instantaneaously so that a macrostate transition corresponds to a transition of exactly one channel. \n",
